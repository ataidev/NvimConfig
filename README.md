NeptuniumVim
================

This config is a mod of [LunarVim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/lunarvim).

It uses [Coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) instead of the native lsp, because
it's easier to install, plus there's no conflict between [tabnine](https://github.com/codota/tabnine-vim) 
and the lsp completion(which is something that I do not want to put any effort in trying to fix, at least now).
