Neovim config
=

This is my neovim config, my goal is to make this my all language IDE, it's unrealistic, but one can dream.

### TODO

- [ ] Fix vimspector lack of highlight on variables
- [ ] Workaround for vimspector support for `env vars` on python (maybe with a bash script ?)
- [ ] Find a way to run specific test methods in python (not have to run everything)
- [ ] Snippets?
